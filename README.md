# Learning Application for Year 3-4 Students

This project is a learning application designed for Year 3-4 students (ages 8-9) to help them practice basic numeracy skills. The application provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) with immediate feedback and hints to engage young learners and enhance their learning experience.

## Features

- **Multiple Choice Questions**: The app presents questions to the students with hints if they answer incorrectly.
- **Immediate Feedback**: Provides positive reinforcement ("Good job!") for correct answers and constructive hints for incorrect ones.
- **Progress Tracking**: Records each student's attempts and stores them in a CSV file.
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs as a web app in a browser (development mode) or as a standalone desktop app (production mode) using PyWebview.
- **Simple and Intuitive GUI**: Designed to be straightforward and engaging for younger students.
